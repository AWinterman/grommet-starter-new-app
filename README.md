# Grommet Starter - New App

Welcome :tada:! Thanks for your interest in starting fresh with Grommet, we are thrilled to have you on board.

## Getting Started

We are going to leverage and install the awesome [create-react-app](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/). We will call it CRA from now on.

```bash
npm install create-react-app -g
create-react-app my-app
cd my-app
```

CRA will automatically install dependencies for you. It uses [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/) behind the scenes. If you prefer to use NPM you can delete the `yarn lock` and run `npm install` manually.

```bash
rm -rf yarn.lock
npm install
```

Start the development server.

```bash
npm start
```
